# Cancer-Goggles-Project

These files are part of a computer science research project I worked on from 2017-2018. The goal of this project was to improve the functionality of goggles
used in cancer tumor treatment using a graphical user interface that allows the user to focus and zoom the camera lens. I wrote the WriteLine code. The imager code was written previously by another programamer, and I worked to debug it (there were hundreds of errors during the first
run through), and I also improved several sections of the code.
